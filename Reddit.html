including your name, address, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">email</span> address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing.<br><br>Reddit uses industry-standard <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">payment</span> processor services (for example, Stripe) to handle <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">payment</span> information.	.<br><br>For example, we may

from you when you choose to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">share</span> such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">IP</span> address.	.<br><br>Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time- we don't <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">store</span> this information on our servers or <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">share</span> it with third parties..<br><br>For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">email</span> address or a mobile-device ID.<br><br>For example, if you <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sign</span> in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">share</span> an <span
